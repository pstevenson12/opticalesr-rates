Python functions and example notebooks for simulating optical ESR experiments

## FineStructureHam()

This class generates the functions necessary to calculate the ground and excited states of NV- and isomorphic systems. The form of the operators, and the notation is based on the equations "Quantum Optics with Single Spins" - Lee Bassett https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05566.
